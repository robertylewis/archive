<p>Hello, That good <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110087">@Scott Morrison</span> , i  have also a version of Maschke theorem.  </p>
<p>But for me the big step is really to make the application over <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="double-struck">C</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbb{C}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.68889em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathbb">C</span></span></span></span></span> ! </p>
<p>For example, the decomposition of a representation in irreducible representation.</p>
<p>I think the decomposition in irrducible part is ok for field (not algebraically closed).</p>

<p>Could we move this thread to the math stream?</p>

<p>I am very new to Lean (Ive checked it in the past many years ago but I had deemed it to unwieldy to get started). I am just curious why the PR for Maschke's Thm don't define the notion of semisimplicity, and just state that k[G] is semisimple, which I think would be how most people would think Maschke's Thm actually looks like. (It unpacks the notion of semisimplicity into the notion of every submodule has a complementary subspace, which I think its equivalent?, though I only work with algebra over (commutative unital) rings, so I don't know the subtleties.)</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="128818">@Syx Pek</span> Welcome! The reason is only that the definitions are not there yet. This PR does all the "real work", and we can easily repackage it in a follow-up PR. I agree that this should be done. We cannot claim that it's completely done yet (-;</p>

<p>In particular, the design decisions around "which definition of semisimplicity should we use" are probably harder than the actual calculation I did in that PR.</p>

<p>There are a lot of ways to talk about semisimplicity!</p>

<p>Yes, I think the issue will be that nobody has defined semisimple algebras yet. I wonder if this is one of those situations where mathematicians are quite happy with several definitions of the same thing but computer scientists can't have this. Is the definition of a semisimple algebra something like "finite sum of simple algebras" or "its representation theory is semisimple"? There are theorems to be proved here and nobody has got round to it yet</p>

<p>It's just that we are understaffed right now because the universities aren't teaching this stuff</p>
