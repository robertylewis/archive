<p>I'm trying to define C*-algebras on mathlib, but I'm running into problems with the old/new structure command.</p>
<p>I have a definition like this:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="c">/-</span><span class="cm">- A normed *-ring, the part of the structure of a normed involutive algebra that does</span>
<span class="cm">  not mention the ring over which it lies. -/</span>
<span class="n">class</span> <span class="n">normed_star_ring</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">R</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="kt">Type</span><span class="bp">*</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="kn">extends</span> <span class="n">normed_ring</span> <span class="n">R</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">star_ring</span> <span class="n">R</span> <span class="o">:=</span>
  <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">norm_star</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="bp">∀</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">R</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">norm</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="err">∗</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="bp">=</span> <span class="n">norm</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="o">)</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>This class requires <code>set_option old_structure_cmd true</code> because <code>star_ring</code> and <code>normed_ring</code> share many fields. However, <code>normed_ring</code> is not defined with the old structure command. <br>
According to <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110043">@Gabriel Ebner</span> this is not supported: <a href="#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/not.20a.20structure/near/199043298">https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/not.20a.20structure/near/199043298</a></p>
<p>What is the way around this? Should I make a PR turning <code>normed_ring</code> (and <em>all</em> other structures in the algebraic hierarchy) into something that uses <code>old_structure_cmd</code>? Or should I, as a workaround, just add the fields of <code>star_ring</code> and then manually give the instance to <code>star_ring</code>? Or is there another workaround?</p>

<p>The <code>old_structure_cmd</code> got its name for a reason. And I think that reason had to do with the fact that it was a bad idea to build the entire algebraic hierarchy using <code>old_structure_cmd</code>.<br>
But I'm not an expert.</p>

<p>Maybe it's time for <code>set_option newer_structure_cmd true</code> <span aria-label="grinning" class="emoji emoji-1f600" role="img" title="grinning">:grinning:</span></p>

<p>As mentioned elsewhere <code>old_structure_cmd</code> is a bad name <a href="#narrow/stream/113488-general/topic/linter.20doc_blame.20with.20old_structure_cmd/near/193763895">and should be renamed</a>. It has features that the "new" structure command doesn't have. I believe the new structure command is more efficient, but I don't think that is an efficiency bottleneck we are running up against (it doesn't help anything with type-class inference performance, which I think is mathlib's main bottleneck)</p>
