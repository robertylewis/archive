<p>I am running summer projects from 30th June to the end of August. I will give two talks per week <a href="https://discord.gg/AnHKcDm" title="https://discord.gg/AnHKcDm">on Discord</a> and generally will help beginners. The idea is that a student should, at the end of it, have a github repository containing working Lean code, and a little write-up explaining what they have done. </p>
<p>Far more details are <a href="http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/xena/UROP2020.html" title="http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/xena/UROP2020.html">here</a>. Things will only get going at the end of June, but I'm setting this up now because people are asking what to do next.</p>

<p>I would be interested! Is this open to not-anymore-but-been-very-recently undergrads too? How open are you to projects that are more on the logic/computation side of maths and have very little overlap with algebra? And would it be possible to start only at the third week or so? German exams are always a bit later than those in the English-speaking world..</p>

<p>I can't offer much supervision on the logic/computation side of things, but you're welcome to join in.</p>

<p>There are people around here that know things about computation :)</p>

<p>Right :-) This whole thing is just a myth, I'm not going to supervise anything, I'm just going to bring a bunch of people together and get them to ask questions on the chat :-)</p>

<p>Actually I am hoping that my performance will be better than in 2018, when I knew very little about Lean and the students realised very early on that they were better off asking Chris Hughes <span aria-label="rolling on the floor laughing" class="emoji emoji-1f923" role="img" title="rolling on the floor laughing">:rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:</span></p>

<p>This time I feel much better equipped to deal with basic questions</p>

<p>If some of the students will want to fill in some gaps in our analysis library, then I'm ready to help mentoring them.</p>

<p>I think that in June when I am out of marking hell I will try and do the analogue of what Patrick/Ryan/Rocky are doing -- go through Imperial's undergraduate course and figure out what is missing. I have not been paying attention to analysis development in mathlib, although I have been keeping more of an eye on algebra/number theory.</p>
