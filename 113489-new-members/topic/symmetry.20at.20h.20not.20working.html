<p>I'm going through the complex number game and, for whatever reason, "symmetry at h" never works for me. I've found workarounds for it but I finally got stuck on a lemma without it and I don't know what's wrong with it. Could I just be on a version that doesn't allow symmetry on a hypothesis? I'm on version 3.13.2</p>

<p>I think you have to write <code>symmetry' at h</code>. Looks like there's a gap in our tactic docs...</p>

<p>FYI you can always work around it with <code>have h := h.symm</code></p>

<p>or generally use <code>h.symm</code> or <code>&lt;- h</code> where you would have used <code>h</code></p>

<p>Sorry, I think I made symmetry work in the natural number game by hackery, expecting lean to catch up some day...</p>
