I am just curious why the PR for Maschke's Thm don't define the notion of semisimplicity, and just state that k[G] is semisimple, which I think would be how most people would think Maschke's Thm actually looks like. (It unpacks the notion of semisimplicity into the notion of every submodule has a complementary subspace, which I think its equivalent?, though I only work with algebra over (commutative unital) rings, so I don't know the subtleties.)</p>",

I wonder if this is one of those situations where mathematicians are quite happy with several definitions of the same thing but computer scientists can't have this. Is the definition of a semisimple algebra something like \"finite sum of simple algebras\" or \"its representation theory is semisimple\"? There are theorems to be proved here and nobody has got round to it yet</p>",
