But somehow I had remorse yesterday because this implicit function is totally explicit. Actually the current version of the proof is not totally explicit because I needed to go to bed, but I'll finish expliciting it tonight. I'm not too happy about how long it turned out to be in TeX, so I wouldn't mind going back to the implicit function plan. In terms of library development I think both roads are interesting. Making sure the implicit function theorem is nice to use is important, and developing linear algebra is important. For instance the elementary road I have in mind would use the determinant of a family of vectors with respect to a basis, and I think we don't have that yet.</p>",
