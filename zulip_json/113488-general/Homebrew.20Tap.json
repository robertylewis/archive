I installed Lean maybe a few months ago (via a nonstandard install in a few ways I wanted to modify) and then didn't touch it much, but am about to try again --  on macOS, it looks like the version that's in the Homebrew core repo is the 3.4.2 non-community version -- does anyone know if there's someone maintaining a tap for the community-maintained one that I can use? (If not I guess I'll try making one...)</p>",
