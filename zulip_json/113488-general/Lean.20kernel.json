The Scala one is the most concise, but AFAIK the Rust one is the only one that's been updated to match the kernel changes from Lean 3 to Lean 4. I'm almost done with a specification of the kernel that was written in Lean just for the sake of convenience; I'll post it in the program verification channel probably at the end of the week. IIRC the only thing that isn't in the Rust one yet from Lean 4 is the new reduction procedure for mutual inductives.</p>",
