<p>Hi! I installed Lean maybe a few months ago (via a nonstandard install in a few ways I wanted to modify) and then didn't touch it much, but am about to try again --  on macOS, it looks like the version that's in the Homebrew core repo is the 3.4.2 non-community version -- does anyone know if there's someone maintaining a tap for the community-maintained one that I can use? (If not I guess I'll try making one...)</p>

<p>The recommended install on mac is via, <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/install/macos.html">https://leanprover-community.github.io/install/macos.html</a> the homebrew tap is completely outdated if you want to use mathlib at this point, as the community version is on 3.17.1. Nobody is maintaining a tap, as we use the lean specific elan to manage lean versions rather than brew.</p>

<p>We're planning, starting hopefully next week, to try to remove the 3.4.2 packages in <code>apt-get</code>, <code>homebrew</code>, etc. Ideally these packages would instead install elan+leanproject, and leave it to <code>elan</code> to obtain Lean versions.</p>
