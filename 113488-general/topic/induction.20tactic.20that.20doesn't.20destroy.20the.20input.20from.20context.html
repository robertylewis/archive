<p>I have a scenario where I need to do induction on a list and (in the <code>cons</code> case) keep track that the introduced variables for head and tail are equal to the original term in my context.  i.e. after doing <code>induction y with hy ty Hy</code> in the second branch I need an equation <code>y = hy::ty</code>. Normally doing induction on <code>x</code> makes <code>x</code> disappear from the context. The docs say </p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>induction h : t will introduce an equality of the form h : t = C x y,
asserting that the input term is equal to the current constructor case, to the context.
</code></pre></div>


<p>That sounds like what I'm looking for, but  I don't know what <code>t</code> is supposed to be (just putting the type of <code>h</code> doesn't work).</p>

<p><code>induction h : y with hy ty Hy</code> I think</p>

<p>I can see why you thought something named <code>t</code> that occurs after a colon was a type though.</p>

<p>Ah makes sense, thanks!</p>
