<p>i hope that this topic will already work organically. most avid lean users likely read kevin's blog anyways, so someone will most certainly post it eventually now that there's a place for it. in addition, we can also use this topic for discussion!</p>

<p>For what it's worth, of course I don't mind what happens ultimately wrt posting here, but I've not been posting these things here myself here because for me the point of this Zulip is that it is a professional place where experts hang out and help solve Lean problems and make progress with lean and mathlib. My blog posts are just supposed to be for a general mathematical audience. I have no qualms advertising them on the Xena discord but that's full of non-experts.</p>

<p>i think that exactly because they are for a general mathematical audience, they are of interest to the experts here. </p>
<p>discussion on how to improve the theorem proving experience also seems to be an important part of this zulip, and for that this kind of perspective (and any related discussion) is very valuable.<br>
after all, judging from twitter, even plenty of people that build theorem provers read your posts (likely for that exact reason!).<br>
besides, as a cs person myself i found many of your posts very helpful, not only to understand how lean works, but also to gain a broader perspective in terms of how decisions in the lean design impact the people formalizing mathematics :)</p>

<p>This is a very naïve and probably not well-thought-out question about the latest blog post. When we want to work with specifications in Lean, we usually use structures or type classes, right? Is the issue with using structures for reals that the API is way too big to hide in a structure?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But you’ll find that it’s a real bore with Dedekind cuts, because Dedekind cuts have this annoying property that you need a convention for the cuts corresponding to rational numbers: whether to put the rational number itself into the lower or upper cut. Neither convention gives a nice definition of addition. You can’t just add the lower cuts and the upper cuts, because the sum of two irrationals can be a rational.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Actually addition on dedekind cuts isn't as bad as this. You can say that a dedekind cut is just the lower set (exclusive), and then pointwise addition works just fine. The thing about multiplication is true, but you can avoid the problem by only defining positive reals</p>

<p>From  a related file I'm (serendipitously) working on, how does  <code>class conditionally_complete_linear_ordered_field (F : Type*) extends discrete_linear_ordered_field F,

<p>The question is: can we do that and still use the notation <code>ℝ</code> to denote some implementation (we don't care which one). And I don't mean having <code>{ℝ : Type} [RealInterface  ℝ] (x y z :  ℝ)</code></p>

<p>At this point I should probably mention that <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="112857">@Leonardo de Moura</span> and I are at least <em>considering</em> introducing a simple module system for Lean 4 (where module = file, not functors involved). It would allow you to view a <code>def</code> inside a file as a <code>constant</code> outside of it (by default or not? All details TBD). The main motivation is to drastically speed up recompilation while <em>programming</em> in Lean, but as discussed, hiding implementations can be useful while proving as well.</p>

<p>I would recommend against tying file structure to this behavior. What about a <code>module</code> keyword that acts mostly like a section, but makes everything in the section <code>private</code>, then compile the module to a structure + an implementation of that structure as a <code>constant</code> + re-exporting the fields of that structure as theorems with the original chosen names</p>

<p>I'm not planning to change the kernel, this would be implemented in the import logic (which also means that we could drastically reduce the amount of data being imported). Autogenerating structures is not realistic when the majority of declarations in each file should be made opaque (at least for programming). Think of it as GHC's interface files produced for separate compilation.</p>

<p>Files are a relatively natural boundary for limiting interprocedural optimizations, especially during development (you rarely want to build such high-level languages completely without optimizations).

<p>For a while now <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="110865">@Jeremy Avigad</span> has been saying that formal theorem proving presents a unique opportunity for logicians and philosophers of mathematics.  Just like the early 1900s when logicians were starting to make formal vague terms like "theorem", "proof", and "algorithm", we have an opportunity to refine those ideas to fit practicing mathematics.  (The example Jeremy often used was that formally logicians say that a "proof" is a sequence or tree of statements with certain properties, but is that <em>really</em> how mathematicians think of a proof?)  I think this problem of partial functions is a great use case for Jeremy's proposed program.  When we say <code>a - b</code>, <code>a/b</code>, <code>sqrt a</code>, or the push forward of the probability measure <code>mu</code> under the map <code>f</code>, we have all these assumptions in mind.  Is there a formal logic (maybe very different from anything out there) that captures these statements and makes operations like rewriting seamless. Of course this new logic may only be an impossible pipe dream, but it doesn't seem beyond the realm of possibility.  (And if it does exist, it may have applications for programming language design as well, since dividing by zero or taking the 101th element of a list with only 100 elements can lead to bad errors in code.)</p>

<p>Also, if there is no such logic (or it is hard to find), because this is all related to the ambiguity of human language, then I hold out hope for soft tools like machine learning, especially neural based AI, which has shown itself to be good at working with incomplete and vague information.  An AI agent could realize that <code>a - b + b = a</code> is "morally true" (as I've heard mathematicians call it).  Then it could prove a lemma automatically by rewriting with that assumption, and then go back and "dot all the i's and cross all the t's" by proving the necessary assumptions needed to make the rewrites work.  Again, this may seem like a pipe dream, but I think the tools we have are making a lot of progress in that direction.</p>

<p>I agree with Kevin that this Lean's handling of division by zero isn't the most important issue facing formalized mathematics today, but mathematicians are right to show some concern. It would be disconcerting if it turned out that some important formalized theorem about perfectoid spaces turned out to be false when we change the value of 1/0. Right now, we don't have good ways of ensuring that won't happen, or even determining whether it is the case.</p>
<p>There is a nice survey of logics for partial terms by Feferman: <a href="https://math.stanford.edu/~feferman/papers/definedness.pdf">https://math.stanford.edu/~feferman/papers/definedness.pdf</a>. The best known implementation of a proof assistant that builds in partiality is Farmer's IMPS (<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00881906">https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00881906</a>), but I can't speak for its usability.</p>
<p>The two common ways of dealing partiality in a type theory involve either modifying the output type to take an undefined value (<code>option</code> or <code>roption</code>) or modifying the input type to restrict the valid inputs, with the condition bundled as a subtype or unbundled as a precondition. My preferred solution for division would be to have the fact that the denominator is nonzero is a precondition, one that is handled by automation so that we rarely think about it.</p>
<p>It is sometimes not entirely clear what the mathematics should mean when we deal with partial functions. There are two ways of interpreting the statement "f(x) -&gt; 0 as x -&gt; 0" when f is partial, described here: <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2883458/what-is-the-right-definition-of-the-limit-of-a-function/2883484#2883484">https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2883458/what-is-the-right-definition-of-the-limit-of-a-function/2883484#2883484</a>. A couple of years ago I generalized the <code>tendsto</code> relation to cover partial functions and multifunctions (<a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/src/order/filter/partial.lean">https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/master/src/order/filter/partial.lean</a>), in the hopes that this would be useful for set-valued analysis.

<p>If the theorem mentions division it's always going to be quite easy to prove the statement about partial division given the statement about Lean's division. Maybe not I guess if it mentions division somewhere deep down.</p>

<p>It's funny, right. Mathematicians have these promises that they will never do something wrong, hence you can swap out objects and replace them by canonically isomorphic ones...<br>
But if you do this with their field operation, all of a sudden they become very uneasy. It's an implementation detail, but we are getting very close to the boundary of where the "promise" still holds/works.</p>

<p>Just out of curiosity, is the choice of garbage output unique (to make the function total)? Any particular reason to choose 0 except that it seems to be more "neutral" than other choices?

<p>I asking this also because something inside me wishes the outputs of further operations on the garbage result are also garbage-ish. Maybe it's just part of the symptoms described in the last part of the post.</p>

<p>I guess the rule of thumb is that the garbage output should make as many theorems still true without the condition that the input not be garbage as possible, to reduce the proof obligations on the user later.<br>
For the square root of negative reals for example you might want that</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kn">lemma</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="n">b</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">real</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">sqrt</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="bp">*</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="bp">=</span> <span class="n">sqrt</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="bp">*</span> <span class="n">sqrt</span> <span class="n">b</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="n">sorry</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>this isn't true without some additional assumption, but I believe if you send negatives to zero then you only need to assume one of a or b is nonnegative, but if you use any other fixed number as garbage then you'll need to assume both a and b are nonnegative for this to hold.<br>
The square root function is also still continuous with this definition, which might be nice.</p>

<p>Exactly. So now you prove a theorem formally, and your mathematician friend wants to know: "Why should I be interested in your theorem? I trust my own theorems because I know what they say. But I don't trust all your formal nonsense, especially when you tell me 1/0 = 0."</p>
<p>Right now the best we can do for a formal sanity check is to find a formulation that doesn't mention division and then prove that it follows from your formal statement. But, as Chris says, when the theorem is built on top of definitions that use division all the way down, that's hard to do.</p>
<p>To repeat: I don't think this is the most serious issue we are facing now. But it is a legitimate concern, and there should be better solutions.</p>

<p>What does it mean to "not rely on division by 0"? If the definitions use our division, and our division takes a value when you divide by 0, the the definitions rely on division by 0. Some of the theorem <code>(x + y) / z</code> along the way do as well.</p>
<p>Mathematicians can (in principle) say that division by 0 is undefined and that the theorems are nonetheless true with that understanding. That is patently false for some theorems in mathlib, and true for others. But how do you tell which is which?</p>

<p>What does it mean to say a "theorem about Lean-fields uses <code>/'</code> away from 0", especially when there are definitions involved? You need some guarantee that when you unwrap all the definitions and quantifier bounds all the way down, you can prove that anything the division every gets applied to is nonzero. If you can do that, you may as well do an automatic translation to a version with a <code>/''</code> that has formal preconditions.</p>

<p>Exactly. It would be nice to have automation that does it.  It is easy to do in simple cases. When I first proved the prime number theorem in Isabelle many years ago, it said "pi n * log n / n --&gt; 1". In the definition of the limit of a sequence, n could be 0. It is pretty obvious that this doesn't break anything; for example, you can substitute "n+1" for "n" and the problem goes away. But I think it is reasonable for a mathematician to complain that an entire analysis library is built on top of division, with no sort of guarantee that it is being used correctly.</p>

<p>I think you need to look at the problem modularly, where you say "does <code>log</code> match what I think natural log is?" If you can do that for all the definitions, then you will have a good understanding of the visible theorem statement, and all you have to worry about is the explicit division in PNT</p>

<p>Given that this topic is about my blog posts, I may as well give you some stats. In the same week that Rob announced that there had been as much mathlib activity in 2020 as there had been in the whole of 2019 (I forget how he measured it, perhaps commits or lines of code), I made it to 42000 views on the blog, beating the 41000 views I got in all of 2019. I'll make it to 50K within the next few days I think. The general pattern seems to be that if I post something which either hacker news or reddit r/math or twitter likes, then I get 1000+ views per day for the next couple of days, e.g. the "mathematics in type theory" post from two weeks ago got 1000+ views for three days from Twitter and then 2000+ views for two days, when hacker news got excited about it. These sorts of posts seem to be the most popular ones -- where a general computer scientist or mathematician who doesn't know anything about Lean can at least read and understand the post and think "hmm, I learnt something about how doing mathematics in type theory / Lean works from reading this". </p>
<p>I will repeat the offer I occasionally make -- if there is anyone out there who thinks they have something which will appeal to mathematics undergraduates who perhaps don't know anything about Lean (these are usually the people I'm thinking about when I write) or perhaps to a more general audience (e.g. people who read hacker news or r/math) then they should feel free to get in touch and propose writing a guest post. So far Chris Hughes is the only person who did this. Ideally the post will have some relation to mathematics, and will be more accurate than the kind of poorly researched nonsense I churn out.</p>

<p>I propose a truce between the "it's obvious from the lemma statement whether division by 0 can arise" camp and the "it's subtle and mathematicians have reasons to worry" camp. Since the proof of the pudding is in the eating, one should just have a division operator that carries a proof in addition to the current one and, for those statements where we care/worry about this, prove the lemma with that operator, reusing the lemma proved using the Lean division. That proof should be easy/trivial in most cases, notably those that have a guard. That's what I'd do if I were to base a math textbook on a Lean formalization.</p>

<p>Funnily enough, I first heard of meadows before I got involved with proof assistants.  But now after I am looking again at the paper that introduced them, I have to realize that they were motivated by formalization.</p>

<p>The whole 1/0 topic is silly and the reason I wrote the blog post was precisely because mathematicians were asking about it on Twitter and I thought I should at least try and put down some coherent thoughts into one place so that I can refer people to it later. But now I'm getting people saying to me that the systems should adapt and make it work the way mathematicians are used to, and just do the type theory way behind the scenes</p>

<p>Yup, it's really cool when it works, but when it breaks it's a pain (at least in lean).<br>
I do think there is potential for something like this. However, I have don't have a good idea how to treat <code>-!</code> when <code>linarith</code> fails. Is the fallback scenario simply that the user must write</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">have</span> <span class="n">foobar</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">y</span> <span class="bp">≤</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">:=</span> <span class="n">some</span> <span class="k">proof</span><span class="o">,</span>
